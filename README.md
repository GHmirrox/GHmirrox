My nickname is Mirrox (might sound kinda cringe but I was 10 then i created it so im just not changing for consistncy)
My english may suck. Thats because i am 16 y.o. kid from Russia.
I am a junior programer, main language now is python(maybe because it is requiered for exams)
Wanna learn smthng like a c++ or html and java cause i like minecraft (yeah that might sound stupid)
My main goal is to become a better programer because why not (im gonna be the coolest mf in school if i do)
You can contact me on telegram if it needed: @Tihomir_listojuy
Some of my projects may not contain object orientated programing cause i am lazy and imho oop is a waste of time for small projects.
Now im gonna go sleep cause thats my main jod rn
